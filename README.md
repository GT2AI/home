# GT^AI Homepage Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines the design and functionality for the GT^AI homepageâ€”a modern, engaging portal that showcases student-built products and the AI Makerspace resources at Georgia Tech.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Data Storage**: GitHub + lightweight serverless functions (if needed)
- **Analytics**: Simple client-side analytics with privacy focus

## Design Philosophy
- Clean, technical aesthetic with dark/light mode toggle (dark default)
- Mobile-first approach designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Dynamic visualizations and simulated "live" data
- Code/terminal-inspired visual elements without being exclusionary
- Focus on visualizations and live data rather than marketing copy
- Open-source ethos visible in the design language

## Core Components

### 1. Header
- Minimal navigation with GT^AI logo
- Concise tagline (e.g., "Student-built AI products powering Georgia Tech")
- GitHub link and documentation access
- Dark/light mode toggle (required)
- PWA install prompt for mobile users

### 2. Live Metrics Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Make the site feel alive and showcase real usage/impact
- **Components**:
  - Active users counter (across all products)
  - Product leaderboard with usage metrics
  - Pulse visualization showing activity over time
  - Latest product deployments/updates (pulled from GitHub)
  - Error/logs feed from applications
  - Interactive visualization (inspired by Exa's network globe)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Initially: Client-side simulation with randomized data that appears live
  - Eventually: GitHub API integration + lightweight metrics API
  - Animated transitions when numbers change

### 3. Product Showcase
- **Layout**: Horizontal scrolling cards or grid of products
- **Featured Product**: GT^Search with description and direct link
- **For Each Product**:
  - Visual preview (screenshot or illustration)
  - Real-time usage metrics
  - Technologies used (small icons)
  - Team members (avatars linking to GitHub)
  - Direct "Use Now" button
  - "Contribute" link to GitHub repo

### 4. Community Engagement Section
- **Live Reactions Panel**: 
  - Emoji reactions that visitors can leave on the site
  - Recent reactions show who left them (anonymized usernames)
  - Reaction counts persist between visits
- **Mini Forum/Chat**:
  - Recent comments/questions from the community
  - Simple post capability (no account required, use browser fingerprinting to prevent spam)
  - GitHub authentication option for named posts

### 5. AI Makerspace Integration
- **Resource Visualization**:
  - Interactive diagram of available GPU resources
  - Current utilization metrics
  - Queued jobs/projects (if applicable)
- **Documentation Hub**:
  - Quick links to all tools, packages, and documentation
  - Recently updated docs highlighted

### 6. Application Section
- Simple, focused call to action
- Two paths: "Build a Product" or "Join a Team"
- Minimal form that sends to GitHub issue or Airtable
- Display team structure visualization

## Interactive Elements

### Real-time Updates
- Initially: Simulated real-time updates with randomized data
- Eventually: WebSocket or polling from GitHub and metrics APIs
- Subtle animations when numbers change
- Toast notifications for significant events (new product launches, milestones)
- Error/logs feed with syntax highlighting and auto-scrolling
- Commit visualization showing recent contributions across products

### Micro-interactions
- Hover effects on cards and buttons
- Subtle particle or code-like background elements
- Purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract

### Community Traces
- Cursor trails or "footprints" showing recent visitor activity
- Heat map of clicked/engaged areas (anonymized)
- Live reaction bubbles that float up when someone reacts

## Mobile-First Approach (PWA)
- **Progressive Web App Requirements**:
  - Service worker for offline functionality
  - Manifest.json with app icons and theming
  - Install prompt for adding to home screen
  - Responsive design optimized for mobile-first
  - Touch-friendly interactions
- **Mobile UI Optimizations**:
  - Bottom navigation bar for core functions
  - Swipe gestures for product cards
  - Streamlined metrics visualization
  - Touch-optimized community interactions
  - Compact error/logs feed
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Lazy loading of non-critical content
  - Optimized animations for mobile devices
  - Reduced network requests
  - Compressed assets

## Backend Requirements (Minimal)
A fully serverless approach is possible with:

1. **Metrics API**:
   - Serverless function to aggregate and serve usage data
   - Simple JSON storage or lightweight database (e.g., Fauna, Supabase)
   - Initial version will use simulated data client-side

2. **Reactions/Comments**:
   - Serverless function to store and retrieve community interactions
   - Rate limiting and basic spam prevention

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Webhook to update site when new products are added
   - API integration to show contributor stats
   - Pull commit history, issues, and deployment information
   - Error/logs collection endpoint

4. **PWA Requirements**:
   - Service worker registration serverless function
   - Cache management for offline functionality
   - Push notification infrastructure (future enhancement)
